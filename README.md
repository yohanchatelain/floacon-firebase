# Floacon

Floacon is a web-based floating-point converter and explorer. It allows you to:

*   Define custom floating-point formats (exponent and mantissa bits).
*   Convert decimal values to their binary floating-point representation.
*   Interactively toggle individual bits and observe the resulting decimal value.
*   View various representations (binary, hexadecimal) and format information (bias, epsilon, max/min normal/denormal).

This application is built with Next.js and deployed on GitHub Pages.
