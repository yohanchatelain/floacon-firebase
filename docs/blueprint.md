# **App Name**: FloatConvert

## Core Features:

- Float Input: Input any floating-point number, positive or negative, in either standard or scientific notation.
- Format Selection: Specify input and output floating-point formats, like single-precision (32-bit), double-precision (64-bit), etc.
- Conversion: Perform the conversion from the input format to the output format.
- Result Display: Display the converted number in the selected output format. Also display details like the sign bit, exponent, and mantissa.
- Error Detection and Advice: Use AI to detect and alert on errors in usage (like overflow) based on constraints imposed by different floating point formats; and use a tool to summarize each type of potential error and ways it might be mitigated by the user.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3F51B5) to convey precision and technical focus.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) for a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight important details and interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern and objective look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear and simple icons to represent floating-point types and options.
- Organize the input, format selection, and output sections clearly, possibly using tabs or a vertical layout.
- Provide smooth transitions or animations when converting the number to show the result dynamically.
